# Burnout-ML-
Burnout ML is a Python project for dealing with burnout in the workplace.

## Description
This project utilizes a machine learning model to compile and analyze a variety of factors to predict burnout likelihood in certain individuals. 
With the surge of COVID-19, it's been over a year of individuals WFH and this inspired me to look at how that has affected peoples well-being with work. 



## Choosing a Model
After trying various linear models, this project operates on using a linear regression model. This was, metric-wise, the best use model.
